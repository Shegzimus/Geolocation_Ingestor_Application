"""
Module for uploading pandas DataFrames to Google Sheets.

This module provides utility functions for configuring a Google Sheets client using a service 
account and uploading DataFrame contents into a specified worksheet. It leverages the gspread 
library and gspread_dataframe for seamless integration between pandas and Google Sheets.

Requirements:
    - A valid service account JSON key file is needed.
    - The service account's email address must be added to the shared list of the target workbook.
    - The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project linked with the service account must have both the 
      Google Sheets API and Google Drive API enabled.
    - The service account must be given Editor access to the target Google Sheets workbook.

Functions:
    config_google_sheets(credentials_path: str) -> gspread.client.Client
        Configures and returns an authorized gspread client using a service account.

    upload_to_google_sheets(credentials_path: str, spreadsheet_name: str, df: pd.DataFrame, 
                            sheet_name: str = "Sheet1") -> None
        Uploads a pandas DataFrame to a specified worksheet. If the worksheet doesn't exist, it 
        attempts to create it.

Usage Example:
    from this_module import upload_to_google_sheets

    df = pd.read_csv("my_data.csv")
    credentials_path = "path/to/service_account_credentials.json"
    spreadsheet_name = "My Workbook"
    upload_to_google_sheets(credentials_path, spreadsheet_name, df, sheet_name="Sheet1")
